To compile and run Lua on Mac/Linux:
  curl -R -O http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.3.5.tar.gz
  tar zxf lua-5.3.5.tar.gz
  cd lua-5.3.5
  make linux test
  
To run on Windows is more complicated, the simplest way we've found is to download ZeroBrane from
https://studio.zerobrane.com/download?not-this-time
and open the lua files with it. It is a full IDE.
