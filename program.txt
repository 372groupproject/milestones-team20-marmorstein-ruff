Our program is going to implement a game. We're essentially going to do "Space Invaders in Lua", a simple space-invaders style shooter game where the player can move an object that shoots enemy objects. 
We expect the program to have at least one file, unlikely to have more since the game will be pretty simple. It will implement a player that takes input to move and shoot, enemies that can die (and possibly shoot back?), and bullets that can animate across the screen and kill enemies.
We expect this program to be approximately 300 - 500 lines of code.
It will be a good illustration of lua because lua has become most widely used for game development. Lua has some useful built-in GUI tools and its versatility and portability make it excellent for game development, and with the variety of functions in a game there will be ample room to show off many of lua's capabilities.
