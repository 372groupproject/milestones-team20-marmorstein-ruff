TO RUN
We've attempted to make this as simple as possible with the given SpaceInvaders.love file. Try to download and run it. We've had some issues with DLL files and it may not work.

If it does not, download Love2D from this link: https://love2d.org/

If for some reason this still does not work, you can install ZeroBrane studio from the link in /code to get all the necessary files. Then it will be runnable.

Worst case, open the main.lua file in ZeroBrane and under Project -> Lua Interpreter, select LOVE. This will run.
